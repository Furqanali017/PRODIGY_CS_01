Cyber Security Internship Task 1

## Task 01: Caesar Cipher Implementation

This repository contains a Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text.

---

## 📌 Task Description
The objective of this task is to create a Python program that allows users to:
- Enter a message
- Provide a shift value
- Encrypt the message using the Caesar Cipher technique
- Decrypt the encrypted message back to the original text

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Basic Cryptography Concepts

---

## ⚙️ How the Caesar Cipher Works
- Each alphabetical character in the message is shifted forward by a fixed number (shift value).
- Uppercase and lowercase letters are handled separately.
- Non-alphabetical characters (spaces, numbers, symbols) remain unchanged.
- Decryption is performed by reversing the shift value.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
